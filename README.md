# Gender_Pridiction_Model
In this Machine Learning Project, I imported a dataset called Voice.csv and use it to train and build models which are able to tell the gender of a person by their voice. I used and compared many ML algorithms such as Rondom Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine(SVM) Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, KNN Classifier And Logistic Regression.
